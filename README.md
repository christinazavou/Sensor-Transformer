# My Experiments with the Sensor-Transformer Repository

This repository was a fork of [aqibsaeed/Sensor-Transformer](https://github.com/aqibsaeed/Sensor-Transformer) to explore the application of the vision Transformer architecture to time-series sensor data for human activity recognition. More about the data [here](https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php).

## My Contributions

In this fork, I've added code from [this online blog post](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/11/implementing-cnn-human-activity-recognition-tensorflow.html).
Before running it you will need these additional requirements: pandas, matplotlib, scipy

## Original Repository

For the original project description and setup instructions, please refer to the [aqibsaeed/Sensor-Transformer](https://github.com/aqibsaeed/Sensor-Transformer) repository.
